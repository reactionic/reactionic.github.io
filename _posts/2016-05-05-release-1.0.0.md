This is the first release of
[React-Ionic](http://reactionic.github.io/). It has all features of
the original Meteoric framework (which was the starting point for this
project).

In its current state, we believe React-Ionic is ready to use in production apps. Oncoming updates with version 1.x.x will be backward compatible. The development of this branch focuses on bug fixes and small improvements.

In parallel, we investigate the feasibility of a v2, which is based on Ionic v2.

Have fun hacking with React-Ionic and please let us know how it goes and what you build with it!

The changelog up to this version is [here](https://github.com/reactionic/reactionic/blob/v1.0/CHANGELOG.md).
